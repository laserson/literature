@article{Schirmer:2010,
	Abstract = {Alkanes, the major constituents of gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel, are naturally produced by diverse species; however, the genetics and biochemistry behind this biology have remained elusive. Here we describe the discovery of an alkane biosynthesis pathway from cyanobacteria. The pathway consists of an acyl-acyl carrier protein reductase and an aldehyde decarbonylase, which together convert intermediates of fatty acid metabolism to alkanes and alkenes. The aldehyde decarbonylase is related to the broadly functional nonheme diiron enzymes. Heterologous expression of the alkane operon in Escherichia coli leads to the production and secretion of C13 to C17 mixtures of alkanes and alkenes. These genes and enzymes can now be leveraged for the simple and direct conversion of renewable raw materials to fungible hydrocarbon fuels. },

@article{Luo:2009,
	Abstract = {Broadly neutralizing anti-HIV antibodies are rare and have proved hard to elicit with any immunogen. We have tested in vitro the notion that such antibodies or other antiviral proteins could be made by lentivirus-mediated gene transfer into human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs), followed by differentiation of the transduced cells into B cells, the most potent antibody-producing cells. To do this, we have developed a highly efficient system for in vitro maturation of secreting B lymphocytes and plasma cells from CD34+ HSPCs. It is a 3-stage, in vitro culture system that supports normal human B-lineage development from HSPCs to antibody-secreting plasmablasts ({$[$}\~{}{$]$}36{\%}) and plasma cells ({$[$}\~{}{$]$}20{\%}). By transducing human cord blood CD34+ cells with lentiviral vectors encoding a secretory monoclonal anti-HIV antibody, b12 (IgG1), we were able to program human B cells to produce in vitro up to 1.5 {\{}micro{\}}g/mL of this broadly neutralizing antibody. Our results suggest that an HIV vaccine might be delivered by autologous transplantation of in vitro-programmed HSPCs, which would develop into antibody-secreting B cells in vivo and provide a continuous supply of anti-HIV neutralizing antibodies. },

@article{Walker:2009,
	Abstract = {Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs), which develop over time in some HIV-1-infected individuals, define critical epitopes for HIV vaccine design. Using a systematic approach, we have examined neutralization breadth in the sera of about 1800 HIV-1-infected individuals, primarily infected with non-clade B viruses, and have selected donors for monoclonal antibody (mAb) generation. We then used a high-throughput neutralization screen of antibody-containing culture supernatants from about 30,000 activated memory B cells from a clade A-infected African donor to isolate two potent mAbs that target a broadly neutralizing epitope. This epitope is preferentially expressed on trimeric Envelope protein and spans conserved regions of variable loops of the gp120 subunit. The results provide a framework for the design of new vaccine candidates for the elicitation of bNAb responses. },

@article{Corti:2010,
	Abstract = {The target of neutralizing antibodies that protect against influenza virus infection is the viral protein HA. Genetic and antigenic variation in HA has been used to classify influenza viruses into subtypes (H1--H16). The neutralizing antibody response to influenza virus is thought to be specific for a few antigenically related isolates within a given subtype. However, while heterosubtypic antibodies capable of neutralizing multiple influenza virus subtypes have been recently isolated from phage display libraries, it is not known whether such antibodies are produced in the course of an immune response to influenza virus infection or vaccine. Here we report that, following vaccination with seasonal influenza vaccine containing H1 and H3 influenza virus subtypes, some individuals produce antibodies that cross-react with H5 HA. By immortalizing IgG-expressing B cells from 4 individuals, we isolated 20 heterosubtypic mAbs that bound and neutralized viruses belonging to several HA subtypes (H1, H2, H5, H6, and H9), including the pandemic A/California/07/09 H1N1 isolate. The mAbs used different VH genes and carried a high frequency of somatic mutations. With the exception of a mAb that bound to the HA globular head, all heterosubtypic mAbs bound to acid-sensitive epitopes in the HA stem region. Four mAbs were evaluated in vivo and protected mice from challenge with influenza viruses representative of different subtypes. These findings reveal that seasonal influenza vaccination can induce polyclonal heterosubtypic neutralizing antibodies that cross-react with the swine-origin pandemic H1N1 influenza virus and with the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus.},

@article{Hu:2010,
	Abstract = {A systematic approach to the discovery of conformation-specific antibodies or those that recognize activation-induced neoepitopes in signaling molecules and enzymes will be a powerful tool in developing antibodies for basic science and therapy. Here, we report the isolation of antibody antagonists that preferentially bind activated integrin Mac-1 () and are potent in blocking neutrophil adhesion and migration. A novel strategy was developed for this task, consisting of yeast surface display of Mac-1 inserted (I) domain library, directed evolution to isolate active mutants of the I domain, and screening of phage display of human antibody library against the active I domain in yeast. Enriched antibody library was then introduced into yeast surface two-hybrid system for final quantitative selection of antibodies from monomeric antigen--antibody interaction. This led to highly efficient isolation of intermediate to high affinity antibodies, which preferentially reacted with the active I domain, antagonized the I domain binding to intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, complement C3 fragment iC3b, and fibronectin, and potently inhibited neutrophil migration on fibrinogen. The strategy demonstrated herein can be broadly applicable to developing antibodies against modular domains that switch between inactive and active conformations, particularly toward the discovery of antibody antagonists in therapeutic and diagnostic applications. },

@article{Dye:2010,
	Abstract = {More than 36 million patients have been successfully treated via the World Health Organization's strategy for tuberculosis (TB) control since 1995. Despite predictions of a decline in global incidence, the number of new cases continues to grow, approaching 10 million in 2010. Here we review the changing relationship between the causative agent, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and its human host and examine a range of factors that could explain the persistence of TB. Although there are ways to reduce susceptibility to infection and disease, and a high-efficacy vaccine would boost TB prevention, early diagnosis and drug treatment to interrupt transmission remain the top priorities for control. Whatever the technology used, success depends critically on the social, institutional, and epidemiological context in which it is applied. },

A process of alternating parallel combinatorial synthesis is used to encode individual members of a large library of chemicals with unique nucleotide sequences. After the chemical entity is bound to a target, the genetic tag can be amplified by replication and utilized for enrichment of the bound molecules by serial hybridization to a subset of the library. The nature of the chemical structure bound to the receptor is decoded by sequencing the nucleotide tag.},

@article{Barlow:1986,
	Abstract = { Protein antigenic determinants have been classified as continuous or discontinuous. The continuous determinants are composed of residues which are local in the polypeptide sequence, while discontinuous determinants consist of residues from different parts of the sequence, brought together by the folding of the protein to its native structure. Searches made for protein determinants using peptide fragments which compete with protein-antibody complex formation, or peptides that can be used to raise antibodies which crossreact with the native protein, are limited to the simulation of continuous determinants. However, recent experiments suggest that most determinants are discontinuous. We now show, by consideration of protein surfaces, that if the recognition zone between a protein and antibody has the same dimensions as those found for the lysozyme-antibody complex, none of the protein's surface will be 'continuous'. We suggest that all determinants are discontinuous to some extent, and that crossreacting peptides mimic only the 'primary' interaction site. In addition, we show that the parts of a protein's surface which are most continuous fall predominantly in the loops and/or protruding regions. This explains why quantities such as hydrophilicity, accessibility, mobility and protrusion can be used to predict which parts of a polypeptide provide the 'best' antigenic peptides. },

	Abstract = {The 2009 H1N1 swine flu is the first influenza pandemic in decades. The crystal structure of the hemagglutinin from the A/California/04/2009 H1N1 virus shows that its antigenic structure, particularly within the Sa antigenic site, is extremely similar to those of human H1N1 viruses circulating early in the 20th century. The cocrystal structure of the 1918 hemagglutinin with 2D1, an antibody from a survivor of the 1918 Spanish flu that neutralizes both 1918 and 2009 H1N1 viruses, reveals an epitope that is conserved in both pandemic viruses. Thus, antigenic similarity between the 2009 and 1918-like viruses provides an explanation for the age-related immunity to the current influenza pandemic. },

	Abstract = {The indigenous bacteria create natural cohabitation niches together with mucosal Abs in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Here we report that opportunistic bacteria, largely  species, specifically inhabit host Peyer's patches (PPs) and isolated lymphoid follicles, with the associated preferential induction of antigen-specific mucosal IgA Abs in the GI tract.  were identified as the dominant bacteria on the interior of PPs from na{\"\i}ve, specific-pathogen-free but not from germ-free mice. Oral transfer of intratissue uncultured  into germ-free mice resulted in the presence of  inside the PPs of recipients. This result was further supported by the induction of antigen-specific Ab-producing cells in the mucosal (e.g., PPs) but not systemic compartment (e.g., spleen). The preferential presence of  inside PPs and the associated induction of intestinal secretory IgA Abs were also observed in both monkeys and humans. Localized mucosal Ab-mediated symbiotic immune responses were supported by -stimulated CD11c dendritic cells (DCs) producing the Ab-enhancing cytokines TGF-β, B-cell-activating factor belonging to the TNF family, and IL-6 in PPs. These CD11c DCs did not migrate beyond the draining mesenteric lymph nodes. In the absence of antigen-specific mucosal Abs, the presence of  in PPs was greatly diminished. Thus, indigenous opportunistic bacteria uniquely inhabit PPs, leading to PP-DCs-initiated, local antigen-specific Ab production; this may involve the creation of an optimal symbiotic environment on the interior of the PPs. },

	Abstract = {During B lymphocyte development, antibodies are assembled by random gene segment reassortment to produce a vast number of specificities. A potential disadvantage of this process is that some of the antibodies produced are self-reactive. We determined the prevalence of self-reactive antibody formation and its regulation in human B cells. A majority (55 to 75%) of all antibodies expressed by early immature B cells displayed self-reactivity, including polyreactive and anti-nuclear specificities. Most of these autoantibodies were removed from the population at two discrete checkpoints during B cell development. Inefficient checkpoint regulation would lead to substantial increases in circulating autoantibodies.
