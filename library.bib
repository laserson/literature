@article{Barrangou:2007,
	Abstract = {Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) are a distinctive feature of the genomes of most Bacteria and Archaea and are thought to be involved in resistance to bacteriophages. We found that, after viral challenge, bacteria integrated new spacers derived from phage genomic sequences. Removal or addition of particular spacers modified the phage-resistance phenotype of the cell. Thus, CRISPR, together with associated cas genes, provided resistance against phages, and resistance specificity is determined by spacer-phage sequence similarity. },

@article{Mora:2010,
	Abstract = {Recognition of pathogens relies on families of proteins showing great diversity. Here we construct maximum entropy models of the sequence repertoire, building on recent experiments that provide a nearly exhaustive sampling of the IgM sequences in zebrafish. These models are based solely on pairwise correlations between residue positions but correctly capture the higher order statistical properties of the repertoire. By exploiting the interpretation of these models as statistical physics problems, we make several predictions for the collective properties of the sequence ensemble: The distribution of sequences obeys Zipf's law, the repertoire decomposes into several clusters, and there is a massive restriction of diversity because of the correlations. These predictions are completely inconsistent with models in which amino acid substitutions are made independently at each site and are in good agreement with the data. Our results suggest that antibody diversity is not limited by the sequences encoded in the genome and may reflect rapid adaptation to antigenic challenges. This approach should be applicable to the study of the global properties of other protein families. },

@article{Munshaw:2010,
	Abstract = {Motivation: The inference of pre-mutation immunoglobulin (Ig) rearrangements is essential in the study of the antibody repertoires produced in response to infection, in B-cell neoplasms and in autoimmune disease. Often, there are several rearrangements that are nearly equivalent as candidates for a given Ig gene, but have different consequences in an analysis. Our aim in this article is to develop a probabilistic model of the rearrangement process and a Bayesian method for estimating posterior probabilities for the comparison of multiple plausible rearrangements.  Results: We have developed SoDA2, which is based on a Hidden Markov Model and used to compute the posterior probabilities of candidate rearrangements and to find those with the highest values among them. We validated the software on a set of simulated data, a set of clonally related sequences, and a group of randomly selected Ig heavy chains from Genbank. In most tests, SoDA2 performed better than other available software for the task. Furthermore, the output format has been redesigned, in part, to facilitate comparison of multiple solutions.  Availability: SoDA2 is available online at https://hippocrates.duhs.duke.edu/soda. Simulated sequences are available upon request.  Contact: kepler{\char64}duke.edu },

@article{Wardemann:2003,
	Abstract = {During B lymphocyte development, antibodies are assembled by random gene segment reassortment to produce a vast number of specificities. A potential disadvantage of this process is that some of the antibodies produced are self-reactive. We determined the prevalence of self-reactive antibody formation and its regulation in human B cells. A majority (55 to 75%) of all antibodies expressed by early immature B cells displayed self-reactivity, including polyreactive and anti-nuclear specificities. Most of these autoantibodies were removed from the population at two discrete checkpoints during B cell development. Inefficient checkpoint regulation would lead to substantial increases in circulating autoantibodies.
